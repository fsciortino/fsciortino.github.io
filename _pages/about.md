I am a recent graduate of the MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center, where I completed a PhD in plasma physics and fusion energy. During my time at MIT, I have been focusing on particle transport and spectroscopy in magnetic confinement fusion devices, particularly the Alcator C-Mod and DIII-D tokamaks in the USA. Bringing the power of the starts to Earth, as fusion research aims to do, is a unique multi-disciplinary challenge, with elements of plasma, atomic and engineering physics -- for short, "fusioneering".

Here is a collection of articles, poems and pages of various kinds that, for one reason or another, I have found interesting.

  ["More is different"](https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf)
  
  This article masterfully exposes how I think about "intensive" vs. "extensive" research, the "reductionist" hypothesis, and why complex scientific disciplines like plasma physics are so interesting.
