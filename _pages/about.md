I am a graduate student at the MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center, working on magnetic confinement fusion. In particular, I have been studying experiments from the Alcator C-Mod and DIII-D tokamaks in the USA.

I am hoping to collect information about my research, academic path and outreach activity in this website. Please get in touch for any questions!
