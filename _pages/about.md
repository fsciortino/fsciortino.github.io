I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Plasmaphysik in Garching, Germany, where I focus on plasma edge spectroscopy at the ASDEX-Upgrade tokamak. 

I am a recent graduate of the MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center, where I completed my PhD in plasma physics and fusion energy. During my PhD, I have focused on particle transport and spectroscopy in magnetic confinement fusion devices, particularly the Alcator C-Mod and DIII-D tokamaks in the USA. 

Bringing the power of the stars to Earth, as fusion research aims to do, is a unique multi-disciplinary challenge, with elements of plasma, atomic and engineering physics. This mix is what fascinates me the most about fusion and the passionate people who try to bring on the energy revolution.

This website collects information about my research, academic path and outreach activity. Please get in touch for any questions!


Latest News
===========
* Oct 14, 2021: the paper "The Very High-n Rydberg Series of Ar16+ in Alcator C-Mod Tokamak Plasmas" has been published in the Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics (find it [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6455/ac2722)). I've really enjoyed contributing to this work led by John Rice at MIT! 
* Oct 12, 2021: a short paper presenting Aurora, a modern package for particle transport, neutrals and radiation in magnetically-confined plasmas (tokamaks and stellarators) is finally available on the PPCF journal website: [F Sciortino et al 2021 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 63 112001](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6587/ac2890)
* Sept 5, 2021: the SPARC toroidal field test magnet has [successfully reached 20 Tesla](https://news.mit.edu/2021/MIT-CFS-major-advance-toward-fusion-energy-0908). Interesting times ahead!

Here is a collection of articles, poems and pages of various kinds that, for one reason or another, I have found interesting. 

* P.W. Anderson, Science, 1972, Vol. 177, Issue 4047, pp. 393-396, DOI: 10.1126/science.177.4047.393
  ["More is different"](https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf)
  
  This article masterfully exposes how I think about "intensive" vs. "extensive" research, the "reductionist" hypothesis, and why complex scientific disciplines like plasma physics are so interesting.
