I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik in Garching, Germany, where I focus on plasma spectroscopy and interpretation of divertor measurements at the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak. Part of my work is also on the W7-X optimized stellarator, in Greifswald, northern Germany. I have been working on tokamak ''negative triangularity'' scenarios on AUG, DIII-D, and TCV, most lately as one of the European Scientific Coordinators within the EuroFusion RT07 task force.

I am a graduate of the MIT Plasma Science & Fusion Center, where I did my PhD research on particle transport and spectroscopy in magnetic confinement fusion devices, particularly the Alcator C-Mod and DIII-D tokamaks in the USA. 

Bringing the power of the stars to Earth, as fusion research aims to do, is a unique multi-disciplinary challenge, with elements of plasma, atomic and engineering physics. This mix is what fascinates me the most about fusion and the passionate people who try to bring on the energy revolution.

* Oct 21, 2021: my latest C-Mod work on neutrals and impurity transport is now published in Nuclear Fusion (see [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ac32f2/pdf)). Keywords: Bayesian inference, impurity transport, neutrals, x-ray and ultra-violet spectroscopy. Studies of C-Mod L-, EDA H- and I-mode discharges.
* Oct 14, 2021: the paper "The Very High-n Rydberg Series of Ar16+ in Alcator C-Mod Tokamak Plasmas" has been published in the Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics (find it [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6455/ac2722)). I really enjoyed contributing to this work led by John Rice at MIT! 
* Oct 12, 2021: a short paper presenting Aurora, a modern package for particle transport, neutrals and radiation in magnetically-confined plasmas (tokamaks and stellarators) is finally available on the PPCF journal website: [F Sciortino et al 2021 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 63 112001](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6587/ac2890)

Here is a collection of articles, poems and pages of various kinds that, for one reason or another, I have found interesting. 

* P.W. Anderson, Science, 1972, Vol. 177, Issue 4047, pp. 393-396, DOI: 10.1126/science.177.4047.393

  This article masterfully exposes how I think about "intensive" vs. "extensive" research, the "reductionist" hypothesis, and why complex scientific disciplines like plasma physics are so interesting.

* Byers, J. ["The physics of data"](https://rdcu.be/cHcKJ). Nature Phys 13, 718–719 (2017). "Physicists are accustomed to dealing with large datasets, yet they are fortunate in that the quality of their experimental data is very good. The onset of big data has led to an explosion of datasets with a far more complex structure — a development that requires new tools and a different mindset."

* Simply wonderful: "We consider all the 175 Roman emperors and propose a new power-law model with change points to predict the time-to-violent-death of the Roman emperors."
