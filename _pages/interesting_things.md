Here is a collection of articles, poems and pages of various kinds that, for one reason or another, I have found very interesting. 

* P.W. Anderson, Science, 1972, Vol. 177, Issue 4047, pp. 393-396, DOI: 10.1126/science.177.4047.393
  ["More is different"](https://cse-robotics.engr.tamu.edu/dshell/cs689/papers/anderson72more_is_different.pdf)
  
  This article masterfully exposes how I think about "intensive" vs. "extensive" research, the "reductionist" hypothesis, and why the description of "fundamental" neither adds nor takes away from the scientific interest in a subject like plasma physics.
  
* Eugenio Montale, ["I limoni"](https://www.libriantichionline.com/divagazioni/eugenio_montale_limoni_1925)
